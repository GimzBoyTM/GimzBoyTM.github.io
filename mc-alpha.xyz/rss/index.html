In addition to the many things debuting this reset we will also be getting on with multiple mid season updates and features for all of you!</p><p>We also thank everyone for their input in the beta a couple of weeks ago and assure you guys that the work you did greatly helped us in our mission to make the best Skyblock experience possible!</p><p>We are also announcing here that Skyblock will fully release to the public on Friday 22nd of April at 2pm EST. The season will feature all of the new things experienced in the beta along with other planned things down the road. </p><hr><h2 id="version">Version</h2><p>Skyblock has been sitting quite comfortably on the version of 1.16.5 for a long time now. Minecraft has moved on since then and for this reset we are releasing with the latest and greatest version of Minecraft.
